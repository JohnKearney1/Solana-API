# Solana-API
This is a custom REST API for the Solana (SPL) network that pulls from RPC Nodes in Python!

#### Note:

This is not the public API! This is the source code allowing developers to run a local version of the Solana REST API I've built on their network for development purposes.
There is not currently adequate documentation on the API, so bear with me as I write it.

You can access the public API programmatically at [api.kearneyjohn.com:8042](http://api.kearneyjohn.com:8042). (It is NOT HTTPS Secured at this time! I will update this soon!)

For guidance on how to use the API- refer to the examples folder. They show appropriate usage of the endpoints.
